# 🌿 Grow-a-Fern (MATLAB)

A fractal-based simulation in MATLAB that visualizes the organic growth patterns of a fern using mathematical modeling.

## 🧠 Project Description

This project uses **iterative function systems (IFS)** in MATLAB to generate and simulate the growth of a Barnsley Fern — a mathematical fractal that mimics natural fern structures.

## ✨ Features

- 📐 Based on affine transformation matrices
- 🌿 Visualizes each iteration of fern growth
- 🎞️ Animation support to demonstrate stepwise growth
- 💾 Save outputs as images for presentation or study

## 🛠️ Built With

- MATLAB (100%)

## 📂 How to Use

1. Open the file `grow_a_fern.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. Adjust iteration counts or transformation probabilities for custom patterns.

## 📸 Demo

> _Include a screenshot or a `.gif` of the output plot for maximum effect!_

## 💡 Inspiration

The Barnsley Fern is a beautiful example of how **chaotic systems** and **linear algebra** can produce naturalistic forms. This project was a personal exploration of how math and nature intertwine.
